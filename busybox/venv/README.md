# Virtual Environment (VENV)

These scripts allow to create a clean shell enviromnent.
We use this as an alternative to create the *lfs* user in a
[Linux from Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/) build

Use the **venv-install.sh** script as a guide to create a VENV

to enter the virtual environment run inside your shell:

    .venv/bin/activate.sh

You might want to couple this with  [PRoot](https://github.com/proot-me/proot/)
