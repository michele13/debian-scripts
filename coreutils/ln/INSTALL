This program is a shell script created to avoid the use of hardlinks.
It may be useful on systems which do not allow hardlinks such as Android.

== Installation ==

edit the script and change the "LN=" so that it points to the *real* ln program.

Example 1: Install the command inside the  home directory.

1. Copy the script to your personal bin directory. Eg ~/bin
2. Edit the script and change the value of the LN variable to /bin/ln

Example 2: Replace the ln command with the script

In this scenario we replace the ln command with the script. 
This may cause problems

1. Move /bin/ln to /bin/ln.real
2. Edit the script andchange the value of the LN variable to /bin/ln.real

You may wish to do the same procedure with the *link* command
